	doi = {10.1109/SANER.2016.66},
	abstract = {Recently, Apple released Swift, a modern programming language built to be the successor of Objective-C. In less than a year and a half after its first release, Swift became one of the most popular programming languages in the world, considering different popularity measures. A significant part of this success is due to Apple's strict control over its ecosystem, and the clear message that it will replace Objective-C in a near future. According to Apple, "Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language[]. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive." However, little is known about how Swift developers perceive these benefits. In this paper, we conducted two studies aimed at uncovering the questions and strains that arise from this early adoption. First, we perform a thorough analysis on 59,156 questions asked about Swift on StackOverflow. Second, we interviewed 12 Swift developers to cross-validate the initial results. Our study reveals that developers do seem to find the language easy to understand and adopt, although 17.5\% of the questions are about basic elements of the language. Still, there are many questions about problems in the toolset (compiler, Xcode, libraries). Some of our interviewees reinforced these problems.},

	abstract = {The relevance of enabling mobile access to business enterprise information systems for experts working in the field has grown significantly in the last years due to the increasing availability of smartphones; the shipment of smartphones exceeded that of personal computers in 2011. However, the screen sizes and display resolutions of different devices vary to a large degree, along with different aspect ratios and the complexity of mobile tasks. These obstacles are a major challenge for software developers, especially when they try to reach the largest possible audience and develop for multiple mobile platforms or device types. On the other side, the end usersâ expectations regarding the usability of the applications are increasing. Consequently, for a successful mobile application the user interface needs to be well-designed, thus justifying research to overcome these obstacles. In this paper, we report on experiences during an industrial project on building user interfaces for database access to a business enterprise information system for professionals in the field. We discuss our systematic analysis of standards and conventions for design of user interfaces for various mobile platforms, as well as scaling methods operational on different physical screen sizes. The interoperability of different systems, including HTML5, Java and .NET is also within the focus of this work.},

There are many survey papers about the cross-platform mobile development solutions but they do not include the most recent approaches, including Component-Based approach, Cloud-Based approach, and Merged approach. The main aim of this paper is helping the researchers to know the most recent approaches and the open research issues. This paper surveys the existing cross-platform mobile development approaches and attempts to provide a global view: it thoroughly introduces a comprehensive categorization to the cross-platform approaches, defines the pros and cons of each approach, explains sample solutions per approach, compares the cross-platform mobile development solutions, and ends with the open research areas.},

Mobile frameworks evolve to offer solutions that allow to simplify the development process in order to achieve products that can be deployed in different mobile operating systems. Based on the experience of the large success of web applications in desktop computing, a similar paradigm shift from target-specific to cross-platform applications could be foreseen in the mobile software industry. Development and marketing practices should understand this philosophy, learn from similar experiences and identify its advantages and disadvantages, to exploit the potential of the opportunities and anticipate to the challenges that changing a development paradigm brings forth. Our objective is to promote discussion by introducing a series of questions to understand how the use of target-agnostic products may shift the mobile application outlook.},

	abstract = {Smartphones provide a set of native functionalities and another set of functionalities available through third-party applications. The emergence of more and more actors, without standards to provide their devices or OS, stops the cross-platform development. Indeed, a developer would have to learn many programmatic languages and create many user interfaces for many devices. To resolve this problem, several solutions often consist in the creation of a com- mon SDK to only write the application once. Then, the application code is translated in native code for each target platform. In this paper, we propose a solution based on a component model. A set of configurable components is implemented for the targeted platforms. A component will have a common interface independent from the host OS. Finally, a new language will offer developers a single instruction call to any component through its interface. This instruction is common on any platforms to simplify the implementation of a cross-platform application.},
